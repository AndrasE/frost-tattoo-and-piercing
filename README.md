React PWA
<br>

</h3>

## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

The app is styled with styled-components, animated using React Scroll, Framer Motion and Lottie, and automatically detects the user's browser language and preferred theme, loading with those settings by default. Users can adjust these preferences, which are saved for future visits.  
<br />It's a PWA-ready (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps" target="_blank">Progressive Web App</a>), installable on both mobile and desktop for Chromium-based browsers. I also developed a custom PWA installation flow that adapts to the user's browser and operating system, providing installation instructions even if the browser doesn`t natively support this feature, such as adding the app to the home screen or dock.
<br />
The project features a splash screen, hero video, testimonial slider, gallery slider, and a gallery album. Users can easily send emails to the studio via a form with guided prompts. The site is fully responsive and has received high scores on Lighthouse for accessibility, best practices, and SEO.
